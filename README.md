Project Idea: To-Do List App

Project Description: Create a to-do list application where users can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The data for the to-do list will be fetched from and saved to an external JSON data source.

Functions of the Project: Users will be able to Add Task, I will create an add task button and a list to display the tasks.

                                         : I will add an external JSON data source to store the to-do list data.

                                         : When the application loads, fetch the to-do list data from the external JSON source using the fetch API.

                                         : It will render the tasks from the fetched JSON data onto the web page using template literals.     

                                         : Implement the ability to add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks. This should involve updating the DOM 
                                           and making corresponding changes to the data stored in the external JSON source.

                                         : Whenever a task is added, marked as completed, or deleted, make the necessary changes to the data in                                                
                                         the external JSON source. You can use the fetch API to send PUT or DELETE requests.

I will also use some css styling.
